## Business Analysis
`Why is this solution needed, and what business problem does it solve?`
* Document Analysis – Review existing documents to understand business context, rules, and constraints.
* Stakeholder Interviews – Gather insights, expectations, and pain points directly from key stakeholders.
* Business Rules & Constraints – Identify policies, regulations, and limitations that shape the solution.
* Facilitated Workshops – Collaborative sessions to align stakeholders and clarify requirements.
* Brainstorming – Generate ideas and explore possible solution directions.
* Observation (Job Shadowing) – Understand real workflows by watching users perform their tasks.
* Prototyping (Low-fidelity) – Validate ideas early using simple mockups or sketches.
* Questionnaires & Surveys – Collect structured input from a large audience efficiently.
* Focus Groups – Gather collective feedback and perspectives from representative users.



## Application Analysis
`What must the application do?`
## Application Design
`How will the application be built?`

* [UML use case diagrams 📺 ~13min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emxjxonNRI) - Lucid Software

## Data Architecture
`What data is needed, where does it come from, and how is it structured and stored?`
## Integration Architecture
`How does the application communicate with other systems and services?`

## Infrastructure & Security
`Where will the application run, and how is it protected and secured?`
