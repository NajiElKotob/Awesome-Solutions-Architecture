# Solutions Architecture
{Awesome Works in Progress}

## Before We Design Anything!
`Why do software projects fail, and what should we learn before designing a solution?`

## Business Analysis
`Why is this solution needed, and what business problem does it solve?`
### Techniques & Activities
* Document Analysis – Review existing documents to understand business context, rules, and constraints.
* Stakeholder Interviews – Gather insights, expectations, and pain points directly from key stakeholders.
* Business Rules & Constraints – Identify policies, regulations, and limitations that shape the solution.
* Facilitated Workshops – Collaborative sessions to align stakeholders and clarify requirements.
* Brainstorming – Generate ideas and explore possible solution directions.

* Observation (Job Shadowing) – Understand real workflows by watching users perform their tasks.
* Prototyping (Low-fidelity) – Validate ideas early using simple mockups or sketches.
* Questionnaires & Surveys – Collect structured input from a large audience efficiently.
* Focus Groups – Gather collective feedback and perspectives from representative users.

### Scope Models
`What is included in the solution, and what is explicitly excluded?`

* In-Scope / Out-of-Scope – Clearly defines what the solution will and will not cover.
* [Context Diagram](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-design/context-diagrams/) – Shows the system boundary and its interactions with external actors and systems.
  - [What is a context diagram? And how to create one (+ examples)](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/context-diagram/) - figma.com
* High-Level Use Cases – Describes the main capabilities the system must support.
* Business Process Scope – Identifies which business processes are affected by the solution.
* Capability Map (High-Level) – Maps business capabilities included in the initiative.
* Assumptions & Dependencies – Documents assumptions and external dependencies that affect scope.
* Constraints – Highlights fixed limitations such as time, budget, technology, or regulation.

## Application Analysis
`What must the application do?`
### Process Model
`What activities happen, and in what order?`
* Business processes
* System workflows
* User and system interactions
* Use case
  - [UML use case diagrams 📺 ~13min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emxjxonNRI) - Lucid Software

### Rule Model
`What rules govern system behavior?`
* Business rules
* Validation rules
* Decision logic

### Data Model
`What data does the system manage?`
* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
  - Entities
  - Attributes
  - Relationships
* Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)
* Data Dictionary
* State Table and State Diagram

## Application Design
`How will the application be built?`

* [UI/UX](https://goodui.org/) - goodui.org
* [WinUI 3 Gallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery)
* [Apple Design Resources](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) - apple.com
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)

-----

## Data Architecture
`What data is needed, where does it come from, and how is it structured and stored?`

-----

## Integration Architecture
`How does the application communicate with other systems and services?`

-----

## Infrastructure & Security
`Where will the application run, and how is it protected and secured?`
